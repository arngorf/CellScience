This software was written to accompany my thesis in examining a FIB-SEM dataset. Preprocessing, semi-automatic segmentation, annotation and storing of organelles, distance function generation, 3D visualization and data outputting is implemented. The software is very rough at the edges in the current form and needs both restructuring, and cleaning up.
